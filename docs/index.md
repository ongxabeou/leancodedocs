## Increase your productivity.

### Cost

You don't have to program the backend, the fontend only has a specific function that you need to program. LeanCode helps you reduce your software development costs by at least 50%.

### Scope

Because you pay little effort and time, LeanCode there are many options to change and modify to satisfy customer requirements. Project development scope is better controlled.!

### Time

You build super-fast functions just by defining functions differently. If to write a function you need at least 8 hours (both coding and debugging) now you only take 5 minutes to build that function without taking time to fix bugs.

## The LeanCode application template

[LeanCode](http://localhost:4200)  is a useful material to help build Applications quickly with very little coding. LeanCode is a collection of functional interface components from the Angular platform, which you can configure to build simple to complex application functionality without coding. LeanCode is developed by a vendor with many years of experience in developing open source software solutions. The system helps to allocate your precious time to business processes instead of dealing with complex user interface requirements.

## Author a couple of words to share

Hello everyone, my name is Tuan Anh Ly. I've been in the tech industry for almost 20 years. After years of developing software projects, I realized that all functions have a common pattern, and it is not necessary that we spend a lot of time developing simple or conventional functions. We only need to focus on the specific functions required by the customer. I named the project LeanCode with the desire that we program less but do more.
